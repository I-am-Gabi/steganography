Description 
-----------

- **cyPyrDown.c**:
	Using cvPyrDown() to create a new image that is half the width and height of the input image. In OpenCV this is accomplished by the function cvPyrDown(), which performs a Gaussian smooth.
	
- **encode.c**

- **filterC.c**:
	This code was made to we understand the basic features of OpenCV. It loads the image through the data
structure IplImage and show in a window. 

- **get_binary_data.c**

- **infoImage.c**:
	A simple way to acesse the main atributes of the image, such as: height, width, channels, size, depth, etc. 

- main.c
	
- **nb.c**: This code change the image from RGB to GrayScale and after change from Grayscale to Binary.

- **negative.c**: Create a negative image from source image.

- **rgb.c**: Get the RGB value in the image where the mouse is over.

- **rotating.c**: We make a rotating in the image. [Read More](http://docs.opencv.org/modules/imgproc/doc/geometric_transformations.html#getrotationmatrix2d)

- **smoothing.c**: One particularly simple operation is the smoothing of an image, which effectively reduces the information content of the image by convolving it with a Gaussian (blurring an image).

- **ycrcb.c**: Convert the RGB image to YCrCb.

- **resize.c**: Resizes the image.

- **cut.c**: Cuts the image given a x-coordinate of the top-left corner, y-coordinate of the top-left corner (sometimes bottom-left corner), a width – width of the rectangle and height – height of the rectangle.
